## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("config.py", "Contains the configuration for the Flask application and the database connection."),
    ("models.py", "Contains the User and Environment classes. The User class should have methods for creating a user and authenticating a user. The Environment class should have methods for creating, starting, stopping, and deleting an environment."),
    ("routes.py", "Contains the routes for the Flask application. The routes should map to the methods in the User and Environment classes."),
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point for the Flask application. It should initialize the Flask application and the database connection."),
    ("Dockerfile", "Contains the instructions for creating the Docker image for the Flask application.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "config.py",
    "models.py",
    "routes.py",
    "main.py",
    "Dockerfile"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
The 'config.py' file contains the configuration for the Flask application and the database connection. It should be created first as it is needed by the other files.

The 'models.py' file contains the User and Environment classes. The User class should have methods for creating a user and authenticating a user. The Environment class should have methods for creating, starting, stopping, and deleting an environment.

The 'routes.py' file contains the routes for the Flask application. The routes should map to the methods in the User and Environment classes.

The 'main.py' file contains the main entry point for the Flask application. It should initialize the Flask application and the database connection.

The 'Dockerfile' file contains the instructions for creating the Docker image for the Flask application. It should be created last as it depends on the other files.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There is no unclear information at this point. The project requirements and technical design are well-defined.
