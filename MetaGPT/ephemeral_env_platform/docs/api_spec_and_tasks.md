## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("config.py", "Contains Flask and SQLAlchemy configuration variables."),
    ("models.py", "Defines User, Role, Project, and Environment models. Depends on config.py."),
    ("azure_manager.py", "Manages Azure resources. Depends on models.py."),
    ("routes.py", "Defines routes for the Flask application. Depends on models.py and azure_manager.py."),
    ("main.py", "Main entry point of the application. Depends on routes.py."),
    ("Dockerfile", "Defines the Docker image for the application. Depends on main.py and requirements.txt."),
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "config.py",
    "models.py",
    "azure_manager.py",
    "routes.py",
    "main.py",
    "Dockerfile",
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'config.py' contains Flask and SQLAlchemy configuration variables.
'models.py' defines User, Role, Project, and Environment models.
'azure_manager.py' manages Azure resources.
'routes.py' defines routes for the Flask application.
'main.py' is the main entry point of the application.
'Dockerfile' defines the Docker image for the application.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear. We need to start with the 'config.py' file as it contains the configuration variables that are used by other files. Then we can proceed with 'models.py', 'azure_manager.py', 'routes.py', and 'main.py' in that order. The 'Dockerfile' should be the last file to be worked on as it depends on all the other files.
