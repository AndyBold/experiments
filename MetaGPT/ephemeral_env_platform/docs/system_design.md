## Implementation approach
We will use Python's Flask framework for creating the web application. Flask is lightweight and easy to use for creating a simple, user-friendly interface. For interacting with Microsoft Azure, we will use the Azure SDK for Python. It provides functionalities for managing Azure resources. We will use SQLAlchemy for database operations, which is a Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system. For security, we will use Flask-Security, an open-source Flask extension for adding common security mechanisms. The application will be containerized using Docker for easy setup and tear down of environments.

## Python package name
```python
"ephemeral_env_platform"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "config.py",
    "models.py",
    "routes.py",
    "azure_manager.py",
    "Dockerfile",
    "requirements.txt"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Config{
        +str SECRET_KEY
        +str SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI
    }
    class User{
        +int id
        +str username
        +str password
        +str email
        +bool active
        +list roles
        +__init__(username: str, password: str, email: str, active: bool, roles: list)
    }
    class Role{
        +int id
        +str name
        +str description
    }
    class Project{
        +int id
        +str name
        +str description
        +datetime created_at
        +User user
        +__init__(name: str, description: str, user: User)
    }
    class Environment{
        +int id
        +str name
        +str status
        +datetime created_at
        +datetime destroyed_at
        +Project project
        +__init__(name: str, status: str, project: Project)
    }
    User "1" -- "*" Role: has
    User "1" -- "*" Project: owns
    Project "1" -- "*" Environment: has
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant P as Project
    participant E as Environment
    participant A as AzureManager
    U->>P: create_project(name, description)
    P->>E: create_environment(name)
    E->>A: setup_environment()
    A-->>E: environment_setup_complete()
    E-->>P: environment_ready()
    P-->>U: project_ready()
    U->>E: teardown_environment()
    E->>A: destroy_environment()
    A-->>E: environment_destroyed()
    E-->>U: environment_teardown_complete()
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
